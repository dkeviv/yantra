## The Moat Summary

**What Others Can't Easily Copy**

* GNN dependency graph - deep codebase understanding.
* Yantra Codex - learning system that improves over time.
* Proactive conflict prevention - not just detection.
* Full browser integration with self-healing.
* Multi-agent coordination via shared GNN.
* Network effects from shared failure patterns.

**What Others Would Have to Do**

Build GNN from scratch (6-12 months). Build learning infrastructure (6-12 months). Rearchitect from "assistant" to "autonomous" (fundamental change). Integrate browser deeply, not just preview (significant effort).
