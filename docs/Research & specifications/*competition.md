### Codebase Intelligence

* **Codebase Indexing & Embeddings** — indexes your entire repo for semantic search
* **Memories** — remembers facts from conversations and applies them in future sessions, creating a persistent knowledge base [PromptLayer](https://blog.promptlayer.com/cursor-changelog-whats-coming-next-in-2026/)
* **Aggregated Diff View** — review all agent changes across files in one place

### Integrations & Workflow

* **Multi-model support** — GPT-5, Claude Sonnet/Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok Code
* **Slack bot** — trigger agents via @Cursor commands
* **Linear integration** — launch agents directly from issues
* **GitHub/GitLab** — PR reviews, "Fix in Cursor" deeplinks
* **BugBot** — automated PR code reviewer that catches issues before merge [PromptLayer](https://blog.promptlayer.com/cursor-changelog-whats-coming-next-in-2026/)
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — one-click server setup, OAuth, elicitation support
* **Embedded browser** — DOM context passed to agent for UI verification

### Developer Experience

* **Jupyter Notebook support** — agent can create/edit multiple cells
* **CLI agent** — command-line AI assistance
* **Privacy Mode** — code not stored remotely, not used for training
* **Cursor Rules** — share custom rules/prompts across teams
* **YOLO Mode** — auto-apply code changes without confirmation (use cautiously)
