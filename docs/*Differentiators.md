"Never break production again"

Or:

**"Change code with confidence"**

Or:

**"Know what breaks before you break it"**


Every developer's nightmare:                              │
│   Pushed code. Broke production."                           │
│                                                             │
│  Yantra knows what your code depends on.                   │
│  Yantra tests everything before you deploy.                │
│  Yantra catches errors before users do.                    │
│  Yantra fixes issues automatically.                        │
│                                                             │
│  Change code. Don't break things.
Make Code . Not Chaos!
